### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

 Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs because it was the start of learning the basics of accessing github, creating the homework directory, and cloning the git repository... as well it was our first time coding which was to edit the hello.cc file on VSC.

* Lab 12
  
 Lab 12, Part 1 was another great lab because it allowed us to create animations which I thought was pretty interesting and cool, seeing the examples on the READ.ME change color and move. Another reason I liked this lab was how to get the colors with numbers like 0 or 0.0 which is the darkest and 255 or 1.0, being the brightest.

* Lab 7
  
 Lab 7, Part 1 and 2 were pretty interesting in my opinion since we delt with putting on dates,days, and time for when to park in part 2. It was pretty confusing at first but after a bit It became understandable creating the functions to display dates.
